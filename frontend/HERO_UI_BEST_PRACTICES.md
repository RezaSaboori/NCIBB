## Best Practices for Using Hero UI

### 1. **Follow Atomic Design Principles**

To keep your codebase organized and scalable, structure your components according to the Atomic Design methodology. This approach breaks down UIs into smaller, reusable parts:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and labels.
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms that form simple UI elements.
- **Organisms**: Complex components made up of molecules and atoms.
- **Templates**: Page-level structures that define layouts.
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content.

### 2. **Embrace Component Composition**

Build complex UIs by combining smaller, single-purpose components. This enhances reusability and makes your code easier to read and maintain. For example, a `Card` component can be composed of `Image`, `Title`, and `Button` components.

### 3. **Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

Each component should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means a component should be responsible for a single piece of functionality. For example, a `UserProfile` component should only display user information, not handle data fetching or authentication.

### 4. **Use Functional Components and Hooks**

Write your components as functions and use React Hooks for state management and side effects. This leads to more concise and readable code compared to class-based components.

### 5. **Leverage Hero UI's Modular Design**

Hero UI components are designed to be standalone, so you can import and use only the components you need. This helps to reduce your application's bundle size and improve performance.

### 6. **Customize with Tailwind CSS**

Hero UI is built with Tailwind CSS, which allows for extensive customization. You can modify the theme, add new variants, and apply utility classes to tailor the components to your design system.

### 7. **Ensure Accessibility**

Hero UI components are designed with accessibility in mind. When using and customizing them, make sure to follow accessibility best practices to ensure your application is usable by everyone.

By following these best practices, you can create a modular, clean, and maintainable codebase with Hero UI.
